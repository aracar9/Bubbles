Segregation of children into small groups for in-person learning during the COVID-19 pandemic

Instructions for running the code for the bubbles within a network school.

The code is written in python 3 programming language, the python packages needed are: numpy, matplotlib, pandas, networkx, random and pickle.

The code is divided in two files, one for the functions (bubbles_functions.py) and one for the initial conditions, the parameters and running the code (bubbles_paper.py). The two files needs to be in the same folder or directory. The file in which you can change the parameters and run the code is the bubbles_paper.py file.

For running the code is also needed another file that has the probabilities of getting infected from a neighbor. This file is named probabilities.csv and you need to specify the path to it in the bubbles_paper.py file. This probabilities were calculated as mentioned in Materials and Methods.

You need to consider that the code may run for several hours as the number of families or iterations are bigger. You must save the results in files in order to analyze them later (in the bubbles_paper.py code you can find at the end some lines to save the file in the folder of directory of your prefference). 

The code is all documented, but if you need help with something, you can contact me.
